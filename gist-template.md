## Summary

## Summary
The regex pattern `/^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/` is commonly used to validate email addresses. It ensures that the email has a valid structure, such as `username@domain.com`.

## Anchors: ^ and $
The `^` and `$` symbols are called anchors. The `^` asserts the start of a string, ensuring that the regex only matches from the beginning of the string. The `$` asserts the end of a string, making sure that the regex matches up to the end of the string.

## Character Classes: a-zA-Z0-9._%+-
The character class `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]` matches any single character that is a letter (upper or lowercase), a digit, or one of the special characters `.`, `_`, `%`, `+`, or `-`. This part of the regex matches the username in an email address.

## Quantifiers: + and {2,}
The `+` quantifier matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character or group. `{2,}` matches at least two occurrences of the preceding element, ensuring that the domain extension (e.g., `.com`, `.org`) has at least two characters.

## Literal Characters: @ and .
The `@` and `.` characters are literal characters that must be present in the email address at specific positions.

## Escaped Characters: \.
The backslash `\` is used to escape the dot `.` in the regex. A dot normally matches any character, but when escaped, it matches a literal period.
